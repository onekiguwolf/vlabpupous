        The objective of IAC model is to illustrate the process of retrieving general and specific 
        information from stored knowledge of specifics. Some of the features of the human memory that 
        are illustrated with this model are:
    ol 
        li 
            p Retrieval by key (name) and by context.
        li 
            p Retrieval with noisy clues.
