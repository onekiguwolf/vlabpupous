            p Observe the initial state of the model has inhibitory (red) connections with rest of the members in the same pool.
        li 
            p Note that the instance pool units have excitatory connections with all related data in every pool with that particular unit.
        li 
            p Note that initially all units in all the pools have negative activation value set at '-1.000' .
        li 
            p After clicking on any node in the 'Name' pool, we see that as the model settles down after calculation of weighted inputs and outputs for respective units, all units have different values of output.
        li 
            p Observe the values for units in every pool and find out which unit has the highest value.
        li
            p Click on units in other pools apart from 'Names' and observe how activating multiple units leads to increased activation to units in the name pool.
