    h2 Aim: 
    p.
        The objective of this experiment is to illustrate the concept of perceptron learning in the context of pattern classification task. 
        Following are the goals of the experiment:
    ol 
        li 
            p To demonstrate the perceptron learning law.
        li 
            p.
                To illustrate the convergence of the weights for linearly separable classes.
        li 
            p To observe the behaviour of the neural network for two classes which are not linearly separable.
