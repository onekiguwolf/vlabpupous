    h3 What is a Gate?
    p.
        A gate may be regarded as a barrier which when closed prevents the passage of information but if opened 
        allows the signals to pass through freely.
    h3 What is a LOGIC Gate?
    p.
        Logic gates are the building blocks of digital electronics. They are used in digital electronics to 
        change one voltage level (input voltage) into another (output voltage) according to some logical statement 
        relating them.
    br
    p.
        <b>‘Thus, a logic gate is a digital circuit which works according to some logical relationship between 
        input and output voltages.’</b>
    br
    p.
        A logic gate may have one or more inputs, but it has only one output.
    h3 Truth Tables 
    p.
        The relationship between the possible values of input and output voltages are expressed in the form of a 
        table called <strong>truth table</strong> or <strong>table of combinations</strong>.
    p Truth table of a logic gate is a table that shows all input and output possibilities for the logic gate.
    p The basic logic gates are: 
    ul 
        li 
            p OR Gate 
        li 
            p AND Gate 
        li 
            p NOT Gate 
        li 
            p Ex-OR Gate (or XOR)
        li
            p Ex-NOR Gate (or XNOR)
    p The logical statements that logic gates follow are called <strong>Boolean expressions</strong>.
    p eg: Y = A + B, Y = A.B, Y = A’ are Boolean expressions for the OR, AND and NOT gates respectively.
    p.
        Logic functions can be implemented in several ways. In the past, vacuum tube and relay circuits performed 
        logic functions. Now a days digital logic gates can be made by connecting discrete components such as 
        diodes, transistors and resistors together but these are less common. Presently logic functions are 
        performed by tiny integrated circuits (ICs). These ICs are small silicon semiconductors sheets called chips, 
        containing the electronic components for the logic gates. The chip is mounted in a plastic container, and 
        connections are welded to external pins which may range from 14 in a small IC package to 64 or more in a 
        large one.
    h3 Integrated Circuit 
    p.
        An integrated circuit (Fig-1), abbreviated as IC, is a semiconductor wafer on which thousands or millions of 
        both the active and passive components as resistors, capacitors and transistors are fabricated. The typical size 
        of an IC is 0.2 mm x 0.2 mm x 0.001 mm. The individual circuit components of an IC cannot be removed or replaced 
        because they are automatically part of a single chip. The different components are isolated from each other by 
        isolation diffusion within the crystal chip and are interconnected by an aluminium layer which serves as wires.

    p.
        A particular IC is categorized linear (analog) or digital depending on its intended application.Linear ICs have 
        continuously variable output (theoretically capable of attaining an infinite number of states) that depends on 
        the input signal level.Linear ICs are used as audio frequency (AF) and radio frequency (RF) amplifiers. Digital 
        ICs operate at only a few defined levels or states rather than over a continuous range of signal amplitudes. 
        These devices are used in computers, computer networks, modems and frequency counters. The fundamental building 
        blocks of digital ICs are logic gates which work with binary data, i.e., signals that have only two different 
        states called low (logic 0) and high (logic 1).
    p.
        Basically, there are two types of semiconductor devices: bipolar and unipolar. Based on these devices, digital 
        integrated circuits have been made which are commercially available. Various digital functions are being 
        fabricated in a variety of forms using bipolar and unipolar technologies. A group of compatible IC’s with the 
        same logic levels and supply voltages for performing various logic functions have been fabricated using a 
        specific circuit configuration which is referred to as a logic family.
    p.
        In1964, Texas instruments introduced transistor-transistor logic, a widely used family of digital devices. 
        TTL is fast, inexpensive, and easy to use. Since TTL uses active low as well as active high signals, negative 
        logic may be used as well as positive logic. Another logic family MOS employs unipolar devices MOSFETs. In PMOS, 
        only p-channel MOSFETs are used and in NMOS, only n-channel MOSFETs are used while in complementary MOS (CMOS), 
        both p- and n-channel MOSFETs are employed in a push-pull arrangement and are fabricated on the same silicon 
        chip. Because the input current of a MOSFET is much smaller than that of a bipolar transistor, cascaded CMOS 
        devices have very low power dissipation compared with TTL devices. This low dissipation explains why CMOS 
        circuits are used in battery powered equipment such as pocket calculators, digital wrist watches, and portable 
        computers.
    p.
        The most popular transistor-transistor logic (TTL) in use includes the 7400 and the 74LS00 families: resistors, 
        diodes and BJT’s are the elements used to construct these circuits. The 74C00 and the 74HC00 are the most widely 
        used CMOS families. They use two different types of MOSFETs.
    p.
        7400 TTL series devices are guaranteed to work reliably over a temperature range of 0 to 70°C and over a supply 
        range of 4.75 to 5.25 volts. The NAND gate is the backbone of the 7400 TTL series because most devices in this 
        family are derived from it. Because of its central role in TTL technology, the NAND gate has become the least 
        expensive and most widely used TTL gate. Furthermore, the NAND gate is available in more configurations than 
        other gates, as shown in table below. The NAND gate is available as a 2-, 3-, 4-, or 8-input gate. The other 
        gates have fewer configurations.

    h2 Basic Logic Gates 
    h3 1.) The NOT Gate 
    p A NOT gate is also known as an inverter. It has one input A and one output Y. The output Y of NOT gate is always complement of input A.
    p In equation form,
    p $$ \text{Y = NOT A = } \neg{A} \hspace{0.1cm} \text{i.e. Y = A'}$$
    p so that, if A = 0, Y = 0’ = 1
    p and if A = 1, Y = 1’= 0.
    p Fig-2 shows the symbol of NOT gate.

    h3 2.) The AND Gate
    p.
        The AND gate has two or more input signals but only one output signal. The AND gate has a high output 
        when all inputs are high. In other words, the AND gate is an <strong>‘all or nothing gate’</strong>; a 
        high output occurs only when all inputs are high.
