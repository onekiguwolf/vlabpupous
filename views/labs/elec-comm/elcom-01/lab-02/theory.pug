    h3 Introduction

        A breadboard is a circuit board that is used to make temporary circuits. This device has holes in it and strips of metal
        below the board which connect the holes placed on the top of the board. Breadboards are solderless and they are made of
        two kinds of strips i.e. terminal and bus strips. Terminal strips help in holding the electronic elements while the bus
        strips are used to power electric power to all the electronic components. In order to form a circuit, wires are inserted
        simply inside the holes. An advantage of using a breadboard is that the positions of the wires can be changed if they are
        placed in a wrong order. The connections of the breadboard are mostly temporary and the elements can further be reassembled
        and reused without any damage. No soldering is required so it is easy to change connections and replace components. Today, 
        starting from tiny analog, digital circuits to big complicated CPUs, everything can be tested with the help of this.

        The name “breadboard” goes way back to the days when people literally used a piece of wood (shown in Fig.1) on which they 
        sliced bread, in order to construct electronic circuits. They used nails and wires to connect up the components. Nowadays, 
        the new generation of “breadboard” is made from a rectangular piece of plastic, but we still refer to them by the name “breadboard.”

        Breadboards come in various brands and sizes to suit the requirements of the electronic circuits. Nevertheless, all breadboards share 
        the same fundamentals and ideas.
    p Here are some types of a Standard Breadboard:

        Moreover, there are different colors of breadboards (white, blue, red, green, yellow, transparent). Fig. 2 shows different types of breadboards.

        Breadboards have many tiny sockets (called 'holes') arranged on a 0.1" grid. Sockets are used to hold the components in a circuit. The leads of 
        most components can be pushed straight into the holes. Total no. of holes in one unit of breadboard is 420. There are sixty-four groups of 5 
        horizontally connected terminals and four buses of 25 vertically connected terminals. The top and bottom rows of holes are connected horizontally 
        while the remaining holes are connected vertically as shown in Fig. 3. A middle divider or “ravine” runs vertically and divides the breadboard symmetrically 
        into left and right sides. The halves of the breadboard are electrically isolated from each other by the middle divider.

        In order to identify vertical columns, letters from “A” to “J” are printed at the top and bottom of the breadboard running horizontally and dividing the holes 
        evenly into vertical lines. To identify horizontal rows, numbers from 1 to 30 are printed on left and right edges on half-size breadboards and from 1 to 60 or 
        63 on full-size breadboards. Some breadboards use skip-counting in fives, but it doesn’t change the main concept of row-numbering on breadboards. Together, the 
        numbers and letters guide us to locate a certain hole easily while building complicated circuits or during troubleshooting. For instance, hole “G15” is located 
        at the intersection of column “G” and row “15.”

        We can see lots of horizontal rows of metal strips on the bottom of the breadboard. The rows or ‘Terminal strips’ are where we are supposed to connect the electronic 
        components. The top of the metal rows has little clips that hide under the plastic holes. This is what the clip looks like when it is removed from a breadboard.

        This means each set of five holes forming a half-row (columns A–E or columns F–J) is electrically connected. For example, that means hole A1 is electrically 
        connected to holes B1, C1, D1 and E1. It is not connected to hole A2, because that hole is in a different row, with a separate set of metal clips. It is also 
        not connected to holes F1, G1, H1, I1 or J1, because they are on the other "half" of the breadboard and the clips are not connected across the gap in the middle. 
        When we press a component's lead into the exposed holes on a breadboard, one of these clips grabs onto it. Once inserted that component will be electrically connected 
        to anything else placed in that row (Fig. 7). This is because the metal rows are conductive and allow current to flow from any point in that strip. Wire links can be 
        made with single-core plastic-coated wire of 0.6 mm diameter (the standard size). Stranded wire is not suitable because it will crumple when pushed into a hole and it 
        may damage the board if strands break off.

        Unlike all the main breadboard rows, which are connected in sets of five holes, the buses or power rails run the entire length of the breadboard. These power rails 
        are metal strips that are identical to the ones that run horizontally, except they are, typically, all connected. When building a circuit, we tend to need power in 
        lots of different places. The power rails give us lots of easy access to power wherever we need it in our circuit. Usually they are labeled with A+ and A− and have a 
        red and blue or black strip, to indicate the positive and negative side.
    p.
        It is important to be aware that the power rails on either side are not connected, so if we want the same power source on both sides, we need to connect the two sides 
        with some jumper wires. We should keep in mind that the markings are there just as a reference. There is no rule that says we have to plug power into the '+' rail and 
        ground into the '−' rail, though it's good practice to keep everything in order. Fig. 8 shows how two jumper wires used to connect the power rails on both sides. Always 
        attach the '+' to '+' and the '−' to '−'.

        Fig. 9 shows, an LED inserted into a breadboard. Here each leg of the LED is placed on either side of the ravine. This prevents the connections to the LED from being 
        shorted.

        Integrated circuits(ICs) are inserted across the central gap with their notch or dot to the left.IC pins are numbered anti-clockwise around the IC starting near 
        the notch or dot. Fig. 10 shows the numbering for 8-pin and 14-pin ICs, but the principle is the same for all sizes.

        Earlier we mentioned that the ravine isolates the two sides of a breadboard. This ravine serves a very important purpose. Many ICs are manufactured specifically to 
        fit onto breadboards. In order to minimize the amount of space they take up on the breadboard, they come in what is known as a Dual in-line Package or DIP. These DIP 
        chips have legs that come out of both sides and fit perfectly over that ravine. Since each leg on the IC is unique, we don’t want both sides to be connected to each 
        other. That is where the separation in the middle of the board comes in handy. Thus, we can connect components to each side of the IC without interfering with the 
        functionality of the leg on the opposite side.

    h3 Example
    p Suppose we want to construct the following series-parallel combination circuit on a breadboard (Fig 12).

        The recommended way to do so on a breadboard would be to arrange the resistors in approximately the same pattern as seen in the schematic. If 24 volts is required and 
        we only have 6-volt batteries available, four may be connected in series to achieve the same effect:

    p This is by no means the only way to connect these four resistors together to form the circuit shown in the schematic. An alternative layout may be:

    h3 Limitations of a Breadboard 
    p.
        Breadboards have their limitations, though. First and foremost, they are intended for temporary construction only. If you pick up a breadboard, turn it upside-down and 
        shake it, any components plugged into it are sure to loosen and may fall out of their respective holes. Also, breadboards are limited to fairly low-current (less than 1 amp) 
        circuits. Those spring clips have a small contact area and thus cannot support high currents without excessive heating.
